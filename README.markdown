# Guild Hail

Guild Hail is a prototype inspired by Playing Guild Wars 2.  With it I hope to address a need in gaming communities.  The need I saw was that guilds (clans etc.), and other sorts of groups or alliances, don't have a quick and easy way to find each other, communicate and cooperate.  And so GuildHail is born.
